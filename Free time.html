        <h3>GOING OUT</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Going out in Strumica is the best.
            So, whenever I can, I go out with my friends whether it is to drink coffee or to go to a bar and party.
            My all time favourite place in Strumica is Sub Club. You should definately visit sometimes.</p>

        <h3>SERIES</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>My favorite thing to do when I need to relax is to turn on a good sitcom or an interesting drama,
            get food and watch it for hours. I love it.
            I have watched a lot of good series but I am not a fan of watching movies.
            Netflix is a lifesaver for people like me.</p>

        <h3>TRIPS</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Good weather, great company, delicious food and a car or two is all it takes to make the perfect trip.
            Me and my friends often go on such trips and we love it when we visit Suvi Laki, Vodoca,
            Dojran and other beautiful places near Strumica in our free time.</p>

        <h3>OTHER HOBBIES</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>I love cooking so sometimes I am using my free time to try and make something new and delicious.
            Reading books is also a great way to relax and have fun.
            Late at night I usually listen to music and scroll through social media.</p></div>
