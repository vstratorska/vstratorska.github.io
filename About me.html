            <h1>FRIENDS</h1>
            <hr/>
            <p> Most of my friends live in Strumica.
                I have a big friend group that consists of both girls and boys and I love spending time with them.
                We often do fun activities or go on trips somewhere near our hometown and we always have a blast singing and dancing together.
                I also have friends that live far away but when they come home, it is the best feeling ever.
                I love them all.
